In this tutorial, we will introduce how to train and evaluate a Linear Regression model using TensorFlow. Linear Regression is of the fundamental Machine Learning techniques that are frequently used. In this tutorial, you will learn:

* the concept of Linear Regression
* the particular case of Linear Regression with one variable
* a working example using a well-known dataset
* how to implement this algorithm in Python and with TensorFlow and Keras
* working on the dataset using a powerful library such as Pandas
* investigating and visualizing the data
